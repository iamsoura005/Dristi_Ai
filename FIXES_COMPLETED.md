## âœ… Issue 1: Fixed 404 Errors for Referral and Staking Endpoints

### Problem
- Frontend was receiving "Failed to load code: 404" errors on Referral Program and Staking Dashboard pages
- Endpoints `/api/referrals/my-code`, `/api/referrals/stats`, `/api/referrals/leaderboard`, `/api/staking/summary`, `/api/staking/history` were returning 404 errors

### Root Cause
- The endpoints existed but required JWT authentication
- When unauthenticated users accessed these endpoints, they were getting 404 errors instead of proper authentication errors

### Solution Implemented
Updated all affected endpoints to use `@jwt_required(optional=True)` and return proper authentication error responses:

**Referral Routes Fixed:**
- `/api/referrals/my-code` - Now returns `{'error': 'Authentication required', 'code': None}` with 401 status
- `/api/referrals/stats` - Now returns `{'error': 'Authentication required', 'stats': None}` with 401 status  
- `/api/referrals/leaderboard` - Now returns `{'error': 'Authentication required', 'leaderboard': []}` with 401 status

**Staking Routes Fixed:**
- `/api/staking/summary` - Now returns structured error with default values and 401 status
- `/api/staking/history` - Now returns `{'error': 'Authentication required', 'history': []}` with 401 status

### Testing Results
âœ… `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/referrals/my-code` - Returns 401 with proper error message (not 404)
âœ… `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/staking/summary` - Returns 401 with proper error message (not 404)
