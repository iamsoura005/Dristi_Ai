## Quality Assessment System

### Quality Metrics
1. **Resolution Score**: Based on image dimensions and pixel count
2. **Contrast Score**: Measured using standard deviation of pixel intensities
3. **Brightness Score**: Optimal range assessment (around 128 for 8-bit images)
4. **Sharpness Score**: Laplacian variance for edge detection

### Quality Levels
- **Excellent** (≥90%): Optimal for analysis
- **Good** (≥70%): Reliable analysis possible
- **Fair** (≥50%): Acceptable with some limitations
- **Poor** (<50%): Analysis possible but with significant limitations

### Enhanced Validation Features
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Adjustable validation criteria
- **Progressive Validation**: Strict first, then lenient with warnings
- **Quality-Adjusted Confidence**: Confidence scores modified based on image quality
- **Comprehensive Warnings**: Detailed feedback on image issues

## Prescription Categories

| Spherical Equivalent | Category | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| < 0.25D | Normal | No significant refractive error |
| 0.25D - 1.0D | Mild | Mild refractive error |
| 1.0D - 3.0D | Moderate | Moderate refractive error |
| 3.0D - 6.0D | High | High refractive error |
| > 6.0D | Very High | Very high refractive error |
