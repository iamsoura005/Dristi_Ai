## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamsoura005/Dristi_Ai.git
cd Dristi_Ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use your favorite Python package manager:

```packagemanagers
{
    "commands": {
        "npm": "",
        "yarn": "",
        "pnpm": "",
        "bun": "",
        "pip": "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    }
}
```

## Usage

Dristi AI can be used as both a Python library and a standalone API service.

### As a Python Library

Import Dristi AI modules in your Python scripts to preprocess data, train models, or run inference.

```python
from dristi_ai.inference import InferenceEngine

engine = InferenceEngine(model_path='path/to/model.pth')
result = engine.predict('data/sample_image.jpg')
print(result)
```

### As an API Service

Start the API server and make HTTP requests to process images or retrieve results.

```bash
python api_server.py
```

#### Example API Call

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
    -F "file=@data/sample_image.jpg"
```

For more details, refer to the API documentation.

## Configuration

Dristi AI supports configuration via YAML or JSON files. The configuration allows you to manage model paths, preprocessing steps, server settings, and more.

Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) with the following structure:

```yaml
model:
  path: "models/model.pth"
  device: "cuda"
preprocessing:
  resize: [224, 224]
  normalize: true
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8000
logging:
  level: "INFO"
```

Load the configuration in your code:

```python
from dristi_ai.config import load_config

config = load_config('config.yaml')
```
